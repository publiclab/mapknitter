	  <h5>Some major limitations that the anonymous maps have are:</h5>
	  <br>
	  <ul>
		<li>You cannot post comments on the maps and be part of the discussion.</li>
		<li>You cannot export featured maps.</li>
		<li>You cannot delete the images -- because as an anonymous user we can't tell whose images they are or who should be allowed to delete them.</li>
	  </ul>
