Cartagen is a vector-based, client-side framework for rendering maps in native HTML 5. Maps are styled in GSS, a cascading stylesheet specification for geospatial information – a decision which leverages literacy in CSS to make map styling more accessible. 

http://cartagen.org is a demonstration of the latest release of Cartagen. Test it out, visit places, and create your own maps!

What to install

Cartagen is available in two 'editions' - each of which fulfills a different set of requirements.

*** Client Edition ***

The client edition is the simplest version of Cartagen, and the easiest to get started with – you don’t need a web server to run it. However, you must provide it with static data or every location you want it to load - it cannot dynamically fetch data from a server. Download a copy from: http://github.com/jywarren/cartagen/downloads

Read more at the Cartagen Wiki: http://wiki.cartagen.org/wiki/show/CartagenClient

*** Server Edition ***

The server edition is not yet officially released. If you are interested in it, you can get it from the development repository via subversion. It is not recommended for end-users, as installation and setup procedures are not fully in place. Read more at the Cartagen Wiki: http://wiki.cartagen.org/wiki/show/CartagenServer

=================================================
Requirements

*** Client Edition ***

Cartagen Client requires a modern JavaScript browser (recommended: Safari 3+, Firefox 3.1+, Chrome)

*** Server Edition ***

Cartagen Server requires a server with Ruby and the following gems:

"json"
"httparty"
"geokit"
"davetroy-geohash"

However you can install these gems by running: 'rake gems:install' in the root directory of Cartagen.
