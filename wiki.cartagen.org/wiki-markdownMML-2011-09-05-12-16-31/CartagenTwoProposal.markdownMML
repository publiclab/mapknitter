Here we are outlining key elements of a possible Cartagen 2.0 release. 

###Structural###

* rafael.js abstraction (upstream to Fred)
* Consolidation of Projection, conversion to spher merc standards
* creation of Scale class with easy conversions, meters/degrees/pixels
* separation of Cartagen javascript code from Ruby - server vs. client repos
* formalizing interconnects between cartagen and a parent codebase for server/client agnosticism
* test suite - base on a test map a la Acid2
* separate Knitter and others into \PublicLaboratory.org mapper toolkit, with raster analysis features -- NDVI, etc
* z-index in GSS spec, use as basis for multipass rendering (casings, dotted lines, consolidate stroke() calls for optimization)
* x,y for mercator, use scale (pix_per_unit), with Projection.units = meters as default

###Rendering###

* dotted, styled line drawing and label-follow-line code
* tween_to, tween_zoom_to, underlying tween ability (upstream to Fred)
* slider for detail_per_scale, to speed up render or improve detail
* clone coastlines from Halcyon or Mapnik

###Interface###

* cleanup and formalization of Tool/Toolbar classes
* Standardize and smoove out widgets (Modalbox?) and such
* debug and optimization for devices (tablets!)
* Cartagen.setup({type:'fullscreen'}) - or 'div' or 'touch', or 'auto'
* Cartagen.add(feature)
* Cartagen.features = []
* Full Cartagen map editor, generating OSM JSON
* Style editor with color wheel, line styling (share with Fred)
* measure_distance(lat1,lon1,lat2,lon2) - or extract_way() with live mouse UI, follow_ways option, follow_tagged_way('highway')
* .wizard() call for GUI map setup
* implement hash signaling for geohashing -- when you move, the URL becomes cartagen.org#==geohash== or reverse geocoded placename, zoom, etc

###Import/Export###

* Import class - native import of \GeoJSON
* high-res, tiled, geotiff, PDF export WITH traced material + labelling
* On feature import, separately save pure features for bbox export in a popup (json) move this to the client side
* TMS generation using to_data_URL or similar -- perhaps stored in localStorage?

###Extensions/Plugins system###

* so building on Cartagen can be reproduced and ported to other projects
