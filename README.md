Use Public Lab's open source MapKnitter to upload your own aerial photographs (for example those from balloon or kite mapping: http://publiclab.org/balloon-mapping) and combine them into:

* web "slippy maps" like Google Maps
* GeoTiff
* TMS
* high resolution JPEG

## Architecture

MapKnitter is broken into three major components:

1. Map user interface
2. Application
3. Exporting system

**Component 1** has been broken out into a new Leaflet plugin, called Leaflet.DistortableImage (https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/) and allows for client-side, CSS3-based distortion of images over a Leaflet base map

**Component 2** is a Ruby on Rails application which is the core of what you've looked at. It stores images, image corner locations, annotations, map details, and user accounts. 

**Component 3** is a set of calls to GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) and ImageMagick which perform the distortions, geolocations, and produce export products like GeoTiff, TMS, jpg, etc. These are baked into the Warpable and Map models, as well as the Export controller, and could use some consolidation. 

Component 3 is soon to be replaced with an external exporter service built in a small Sinatra app called [mapknitter-exporter-sinatra](https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter-exporter-sinatra) using the [mapknitter-exporter](https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter-exporter) gem.

Another moving part is the new-ish Annotations 2.0 which uses Leaflet.Illustrate (https://github.com/manleyjster/Leaflet.Illustrate) to provide rich annotation on top of maps. 

## Installation

### Quick install

We provide an install script for Amazon's Cloud9 service, which provides standard Linux virtual machines with a web-based editor: https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/

To use it:

1. Click `Create new workspace`
2. Name your workspace and enter `https://github.com/USERNAME/mapknitter` (where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username) under `Clone from Git or Mercurial URL`
3. Choose `Ruby` template
4. Click `Create workspace`
5. Once it loads, in the `bash` console at the bottom of the screen, type `source install_cloud.sh`
6. Press `Control-x` when prompted for a message.
7. Wait for the installation to run, and when it's complete, press the `Run` button at the top of the page.
8. Open the URL which pops up to see MapKnitter booted up. Great work!

If you have any trouble installing, we're sorry! **Please [click here](https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter/issues/307) to get support.**

### Installation video

For a run-through of the Prerequisites and Installation steps listed below, you can watch the install video at:

http://youtu.be/iGYGpS8rZMY (may be slightly out of date, but gives an overview)

### Prerequisites

Recommended; for an Ubuntu/Debian system. Varies slightly for mac/fedora/etc

Install a database, if necessary. sqlite does not seem to work due to some table constraints.

`sudo apt-get install mysql-server`

Application-specific dependencies:

`sudo apt-get install bundler libmysqlclient-dev imagemagick ruby-rmagick libfreeimage3 libfreeimage-dev ruby-dev libmagickcore-dev libmagickwand-dev`

(optional) For exporting, you'll need GDAL >=1.7.x (gdal.org), as well as `curl` and `zip`-- but these are not needed for much of development, unless you're working on the exporting features. 

`sudo apt-get install gdal-bin python-gdal curl libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev zip`

Install RVM for Ruby management (http://rvm.io)

`curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`

**Note:** At this point during the process, you may want to log out and log back in, or open a new terminal window; RVM will then properly load in your environment. 

**Ubuntu users:** You may need to enable `Run command as a login shell` in Ubuntu's Terminal, under Profile Preferences > Title and Command. Then close the terminal and reopen it.

Then, use RVM to install version 2.4.6 of Ruby:

`rvm install 2.4.6`

You'll also need **bower** which is available through NPM. To install NPM, you can run:

`sudo apt-get install npm`

However, on Ubuntu, you may need to also install the `nodejs-legacy` package, as due to a naming collision, some versions of Ubuntu already have an unrelated package called `node`. To do this, run:

`sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy`

Once NPM is installed, you should be able to run:

`sudo npm install -g bower`

### Standard Installation

You'll need Ruby v2.4.6 (use your local ruby version management system - RVM / rbenv / etc. - to install and set locally)

1. Download a copy of the source with `git clone https://github.com/publiclab/mapknitter.git` 
2. Install gems with `bundle install` from the rails root folder. You may need to run `bundle update` if you have older gems in your environment.
3. Copy and configure config/database.yml from config/database.yml.example, using a new empty database you've created
4. Copy and configure config/config.yml from config/config.yml.example (for now, this is only for the [Google Maps API Key, which is optional](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2769148/whats-the-api-key-for-in-google-maps-api-v3), and a path for [logging in when running locally, also optional](#Logging-in-when-running-locally))
5. Initialize database with `bundle exec rake db:setup`
6. Enter ReCaptcha public and private keys in config/initializers/recaptcha.rb, copied from recaptcha.rb.example. To get keys, visit https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create
7. Install static assets (like external javascript libraries, fonts) with `bower install` 
8. Start rails with `bundle exec passenger start` from the Rails root and open http://localhost:3000 in a web browser. (For some, just `passenger start` will work; adding `bundle exec` ensures you're using the version of passenger you just installed with Bundler.)

### Running tests

When you try to run tests in Mapknitter, you can the default Rake tasks, such as:

`rake test:units`
`rake test:functionals`
`rake test:integration`

or simply:

`rake test`

By running like this you'll see a lot of warnings and deprecation notices - FOR NOW -, but we're working on them. If you'd like a cleaner visual of your tests, you can just use our task defined as:

`rake test:all`

## Logging in when running locally

Because MapKnitter uses a remote OpenID login system that depends on PublicLab.org, it can be hard to log in when running it locally. To get around this, we've created a local login route that requires no password:

You can log in locally at the path `http://localhost:3000/local/USERNAME` where `USERNAME` is any username.

For this to work:

 - You will need to have copied and configured config/config.yml from config/config.yml.example

 - The user has to be an existing record. For your convenience, we have added two user accounts in [seeds.rb](./db/seeds.rb) to make their corresponding paths available in development after installation:

```Ruby
# basic account path - http://localhost:3000/local/harry
# created from:
User.create({login: 'harry', name: 'harry potter', email: 'potter@hogwarts.com'})

# admin account path - http://localhost:3000/local/albus
# created from:
u_admin = User.create({login: 'albus', name: 'albus dumbledore', email: 'dumbledore@hogwarts.com'})
u_admin.role = 'admin'
```

## Bugs and support

* Some devs hang out in http://publiclab.org/chat (irc webchat)

## Staging infrastructure and testing

In addition automatic testing with Travis CI - we have a branch (`unstable`) is set to auto-build and deploy to [a staging instance](http://mapknitter-unstable.laboratoriopublico.org/). This instance includes a copy of the production database and is intended for experimenting or debugging purposes with a production-like environment. We also have a `stable` build at http://mapknitter-unstable.laboratoriopublico.org/ which builds off of our `main` branch. Any commits or PRs merged to the main branch will trigger the `stable` server to rebuild; you can monitor progress at https://jenkins.laboratoriopublico.org/
